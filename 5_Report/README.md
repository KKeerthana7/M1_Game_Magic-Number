# Requirements:
# Introduction : Magic number
     A number is said to be a Magic Number, if the recursive sum of the digits up to single digit will be equal to 1.
# Features:
     If the single digit of the given sum of the digits is 1 the the number is called a magic number.
     for example,For example, 325 is a magic number because the sum of its digits (3+2+5) is 10, and again sum up the resultant (1+0), we get a single digit (1) as the result. Hence, the number 325 is a magic number.
# Swot Analysis:
Strength - It is easier to read and understnand.

Weakness - It may makes the code more verbose.

Oppurtunity - Learn the tricks of numericals.

Threats - No software can be created.
